You should provide code that works with python 3.12 and later. Uses of things like `Optional` should be replaced with `| None` for type hints, as this is the modern syntax in Python 3.10 and later.

If necessary to run the code, assume that a uv environment is available and python can be run with `uv run python <filename>`.
