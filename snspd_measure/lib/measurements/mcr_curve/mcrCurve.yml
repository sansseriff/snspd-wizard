#=============== MCR Curve Measurement Configuration ===============#

measurement:
  collectData:
    biasCurrent: 31.4 # bias current to use on the detector during the MCR sweep
    attenMax: 55 # in dB, this is the maximum attenuation that will be split between three attenuator channels.
    attenRange: 35 # the range of atten which will be split between atten 1 and 2
    attenStep: 1
    attenWave: 1.56e-6 # in m

    atten4: 40 #in dB, if you are using an extra constant attenuation on channel 4
    measureInputPower: True #If you're splitting off some of the input power and measuring it with a thorlabs power meter

  comments: 1550nm cw -25 mV threshold no filter
